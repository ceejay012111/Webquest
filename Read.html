        <h1>Alright, Fairies and Elves, are you all ready?
</h1>
	<p>	The five of you will form a group and will work together while exploring this journey you should finish. If you are able to finish the journey, the Fairy Queen will give you a prize, it can be a pixie dust, magic mushroom, or even a sparkling dew! Anything you like!
</p>
  <p>What do you think is the goal of this journey? It is to learn what obedience is, why it is important and how we can show it at home.
</p>


<h1>Your Team Journey
</h1>
  <p>As a group, youâ€™ll need to demonstrate at home the different activities that will help you understand what obedience is. Not only that, you need to do the environmental activities for us to be protectors of our environment. Understand, Fairies and Elves?
</p>
  <p>But before that, I want you to call your parents and ask for their help in the activities and in documenting.</p>
